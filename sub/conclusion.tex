\section{Discussion}

Spring (April) and fall (November) each had 1.2 - 1.3 $\rm mg~m^{-3}$, 0.9 - 1.0 $\rm mg~m^{-3}$ of chlorophyll-a concentrations which was higher than the other seasons showing similarities with the result of Yamada et al. \cite{yamada2004seasonal}. Analysis of annual variability with the temporal resolution increased to 8-day-mean data although not shown here concluded winter (December, January, February) had higher concentration compared to summer (June, July, August), each with the values of 0.6 $\rm mg~m^{-3}$ and $\rm mg~m^{-3}$. It is assumed that the East Sea shows clear seasonal differences.

In a perspective of spatial resolution, both LAC data and GAC data were suitable for research on the chlorophyll-a concentration variability in the East Sea because both data showed similar tendency. However, for long-term research GAC data is recommended since it has more consistent data. 

Considering speckle errors should be also discussed. LAC data could have more pixels over 10 $\rm mg~m^{-3}$ compared to GAC data because it has more speckles. Also LAC data was found out to have higher maximum value of chlorophyll-a concentration compared to GAC data, and this could also be the effect of speckle errors. However, such result could be also caused by the way LAC data and GAC data are created. Since GAC data average on 16 pixels of LAC data into one pixel, high-concentration values could be weakened in the process. 

The limit of this research is that speckle errors were not corrected, which caused the concentration values to be higher than the in-situ data. Moreover, the in-situ data of the area of interest was not measured in this research, so it could not directly show whether LAC data or GAC data is more accurate. Further research will compare the processed data of LAC and GAC with the in-situ data from previous researches.
